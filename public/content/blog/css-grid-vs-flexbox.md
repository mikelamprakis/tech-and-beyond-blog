# CSS Grid vs Flexbox: Choosing the Right Layout System

CSS offers two powerful layout systems: Grid and Flexbox. While they share some similarities, they each have distinct purposes and strengths. This guide will help you understand when to use each.

## CSS Grid: Two-Dimensional Layout

CSS Grid is designed for two-dimensional layouts, allowing you to control both rows and columns simultaneously.

### When to Use Grid:

- Building complex, multi-row and multi-column layouts
- Creating grid-based designs with precise control
- Implementing full-page layouts
- When you need to overlap elements

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  grid-template-rows: 100px 200px;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

## Flexbox: One-Dimensional Layout

Flexbox excels at one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column.

### When to Use Flexbox:

- Aligning items within a single row or column
- Creating flexible components that expand or shrink
- Building navigation menus or toolbars
- Centering elements vertically and horizontally

```css
.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
  align-items: center;
}
```

## Combining Both for Optimal Layouts

For modern web design, the best approach is often to use both:

- CSS Grid for the overall page layout
- Flexbox for aligning content within grid items

```css
.page-layout {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.navigation {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}
```

## Browser Support

Both Grid and Flexbox enjoy excellent browser support today:

- CSS Grid: Supported in all modern browsers
- Flexbox: Supported in all modern browsers, with some legacy browser issues

## Conclusion

Choose CSS Grid when you need to control layout in two dimensions. Select Flexbox when you're working with one-dimensional layouts or need flexibility in content alignment.

By understanding the strengths of each system, you can create more efficient and maintainable CSS layouts that work across all device sizes.
